# LiO2-doped thermal neutron bundle in GEANT4
Reference: https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2406.15462 
* 20x34 10% LiO2-doped Kuraray Y11-200(M) plastic scintillating fibers.
* 20x34 Pixel photo-sensors;
* One is suppsoed to use the executable+run1.mac without any change to employ the GEANT4 package appropriately;
* If/when necessary, one is supposed to remove/close the visualization macro (vis.mac) in run1.mac to prevent any possible computer crash.
